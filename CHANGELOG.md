# Station V - Virtual World Editor Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.3] - Bug Fixes & Enhancements

### ‚ú® Features
- **Add Channel-Only Export**: Added an "Export Channels (JSON)" option to the Import/Export modal. This allows for backing up channel configurations independently of user data, offering more granular control over data management.

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Fix User Re-import Error**: Corrected an issue where the "Export Users (JSON)" function, intended for the simulator, would strip essential editor data (like the `id` field). This prevented the exported file from being re-imported into the editor. The export now preserves all original data, making the file fully compatible for both simulator use and editor re-importing.

## [1.1.2] - Documentation Update

### üìö Documentation

- **Add World Export Format Documentation**: Created a new detailed HTML document (`WorldEditor_JSON_WorldExport.html`) that specifies the structure of the "World Export" JSON file. This documentation clarifies the format used for creating full backups of the editor's state, distinguishing it from the simulator-specific user export.

## [1.1.1] - Compatibility Fix

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Fix JSON Export Compatibility**: The "Full World" JSON export format was incompatible with the main Station V IRC Simulator, which expects a simple array of users.
  - Added a new, dedicated **"Export Users (JSON)"** button. This option generates a file containing only the user list in the correct format for the simulator.
  - The original JSON export has been renamed to **"Export World (JSON)"** and is now intended for full editor backups only.
  - The UI has been updated to clearly separate the export options for "Simulator Compatibility" versus "Full World Backup" to prevent confusion.

## [1.1.0] - UI Enhancements & Data Sync

### üöÄ Features & Enhancements

#### ‚ú® **User List View Switcher**
- **New List View**: The user list now defaults to a compact, single-column "List View" that is easier to scan when managing a large number of users.
- **View Toggle**: A new icon-based toggle in the "Virtual Users" header allows you to seamlessly switch between the new scannable list and the original detailed grid view.
- **Improved Readability**: The list view provides a cleaner, more organized way to browse users, showing essential information at a glance.

#### üíæ **Unified World Data Format**
- **Robust JSON Export**: Exporting to JSON now saves a single, structured "world" file containing both `users` and `channels`. This unified format prevents data sync issues with the main IRC simulator.
- **Smarter Import Logic**: The import system now intelligently detects the JSON structure, ensuring backward compatibility with older, user-only JSON files while supporting the new world format.
- **UI Clarity**: The text in the Import/Export modal has been updated to clearly distinguish between a "Full World" (JSON) export and a "Users Only" (CSV) export.
